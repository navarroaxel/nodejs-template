# Architecture

## toolkit
Presents common functions independent of the business: validations, security, logging, etc.

## model
Defines the entities of the application, these are objects not defined by its attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and its identity.
The business logic should be placed in this module. The approach to develop a complex application using here is Domain drive-design http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design

## services
When an operation does not conceptually belong to any object. Following the natural contours of the problem, you can implement these operations in services.

## routes
Handles the HTTP requests. The business logic should not be placed here because this routers are attached to the HTTP protocol, it's hard to test and cannot be reused easily.
The public-api folder is public and does not need a user's session.
The api folder is a private API and need a valid user's session to use.

## public
This is all the client side content, the user can access this content freely.
The front-end is an AngularJS app using the SPA approach.
The controls folder is a collection of Angular's directives that representes a business object, i.e. the html tag <customer ng-model="customer" /> is replaced with the readonly customer profile to be displayed everywhere in the app.

## config
The config.json file is located in the root folder.

## resources
All the html to build PDFs or e-mails, or another type of media resources for server side process.
